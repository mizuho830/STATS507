# STATS507
=====STATISTICS 507 University of Michigan, 2024 Fall =====

This course focuses on using programming tools, particularly Python, to implement statistical analysis through code. 
The class will emphasize not only programming but also statistical analysis techniques- so it is useful for both computer science background and statistics background student as we can teach each other from their own experiences.
For the final project, each student will have the opportunity to design and implement their own individual project.

Purpose of this Repository:
This repository is primarily intended to store our code from class discussions and homework assignments. 
Additionally, it will be shared publicly for the final projects so that we can learn and improve our version control skills.
